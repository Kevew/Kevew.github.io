This club, unlike other sorts of STEM outreachs, forces \n                      the members to be independent. There are instructors but you must first research whatever problem you are encountering before asking. \n                      As a result, this club was an excellent opportunity to learn about teamwork, independent work, and communication. \n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(2)\" src=\"@/assets/2019VV.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\"><p>A photo of my team members back in early 2021</p></div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <p>While 12 weeks of development may seem like much, if you actually calculate it, it's about 48 hours of total development time. \n                      This doesn't include two meetings for presentation and week 1 for design, which really leaves you with only 36 hours to develop a project.\n                      This is basically the same thing as a 2-day game jam which is not a lot of time. <br> <br>\n\n                      Still, from 2017 to early 2021, I rigorously attended this club multiple times. I learned how to use Unity, C#, and Java as I tried out different projects.\n                      My favorite two are: \n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R0L7FRoSW0pJyYyXSvn9eZYlKWU6jrrgWlblBRTnbBQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Botanical Rumble</a>\n                      and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A2erx_96anwyrVEBjN2hmZiu5Holr6Tvqioauukw2PY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Bubble Shooter</a>\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(3)\" src=\"@/assets/2022Instructor.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(4)\" src=\"@/assets/2022Instructor2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <p> With my last project in 2021 and the club moving to virtual, I thought it was a nice time to do \n                      something a little different. So, I took the initiative and asked the instructors running the club if I could volunteer for it. Thru this, I\n                      managed to get my 40 hours of volunteer plus an extra 90 hours as well. As 2022 rolled around, I was promoted to being an actual instructor and worked\n                      every Saturday by answering questions and helping out the students. Seeing the 12 weeks go by, I noticed a position for a full-time position \n                      during Summer as an Instructor and applied. <br> <br>\n\n                      It was one of the best experiences I've ever had and I've learned a lot. I worked with kids from kindergarten all the way up to grade 9. The first\n                      week was quite chaotic but with the help of my co-workers, I got the hang of it. It was quite interesting interacting with people with\n                      different outlooks than mine. <br> <br>\n\n                      Since then, I've worked as another Saturday Club Instructor and now fill in as a substitute in case an instructor is missing or can't make it.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"tab\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(5)\" src=\"@/assets/NokiaLogo.webp\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\">Nokia</h1>\n                    <p>Recently, I took a co-op course for my 2022 Fall semester. Seeing an opportunity for a Nokia Co-Op and with my \n                       prior experiences in the technology sector, I decided to apply for it. The Co-Op was about\n                       Software Installations and Networking. It was an excellent fit for me, who at this point in time, was looking to explore different aspects of technology\n                       so I could get a better understanding of what I want to do in the future.<br><br>\n\n                       For the first month of the Co-Op, I spent a lot of time learning about networking and exactly how it worked. The lab I worked in was large with\n                       hundreds of chassis constantly doing jobs. However, over the first month, as I explored different tasks, I found a task that suited my abilities much\n                       better. One of the tools my supervisor uses quite often is something called OTS. It's basically their in-house order tracking system and seeing a chance.\n                       I asked to do some tasks related to it. As a result, from the second month onwards, I was given the task to help develop and maintain the OTS website.\n                       Since the website used NodeJs, VueJs, and HTML, I had to learn quite a bit. I even used most of the knowledge gained to develop this very website.\n\n                       <br><br>\n\n                       I find this experience fascinating because it felt like my first proper work experience. My previous job as an instructor in Virtual Ventures was\n                       much more informal. This experience was different. Professionalism was at the forefront of my thoughts and I really felt the gap of experience between\n                       me and some of my co-workers. Problems that may take hours for me to solve was a problem they experienced before and can easily solve now. This Co-Op\n                       experience taught me a lot and widen my horizons on what I was capable of doing.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"tab\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(6)\" src=\"@/assets/EarlofMarchLogo.png\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\">Grade 12 CS Project</h1>\n                    <p> In 2021, I took my Grade 12 CS class early because I was really excited about it.

We also do virtual contests with them where we have fun competing against each other for fun.\n                      All in all, it's been a great experience with them.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(8)\" src=\"@/assets/ClubContest.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(9)\" src=\"@/assets/ClubPhoto.png\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <p> Here are some examples of our dicussions: <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3vfKaHoYgg565cam1942WoJPU4ZWSTmaOQa6EqYHww/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion Of A Problem</a> <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uqlGYOVXFEdq3BgKva775yKgqx-XtmqYBwUPJXSPYWo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion of ASCII</a> <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XOsFTnPsaDgy6FpFZP7jSH49OK5cyZZoR0U1_1999xM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion of Sorting</a>\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <div class=\"popup-img\">\n        <span @click=\"closeImage\">&times;</span>\n        <img src=\"@/assets/CCCResult.jpg\">\n      </div>\n  </v-app>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\nimport Navbar from '../components/NavBar'\n\nexport default{\n  name: 'AchievementsView',\n  components: {\n      Navbar,\n  },\n  data () {\n      return {\n          itemMenu: [],\n          btnLeft: [],\n          btnRight: [],\n          activeDrag: false,\n          tabs: [],\n          items: [],\n          popUpImage: [],\n          popUp: [],\n          allImages: []\n      }\n  },\n  methods: {\n      checkVisibility(){\n          let scrollLeftValue = Math.ceil(this.itemMenu.scrollLeft);\n          let scrollableWidth = this.itemMenu.scrollWidth - this.itemMenu.clientWidth;\n          this.btnLeft.style.display = scrollLeftValue > 0 ?
