It's still running to this day! \n            The big contest I wanted to get a decent score in was the <a href=\"https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc-cco.html\">CCC</a> and in 2021, I achieve group 3\n            in senior with a score of 45 (Top 3% in Canada).\n            <br><br>\n            Nowadays, I have a co-op at Nokia as a Network and Software Installation (though I mostly do full-stack development). I am constantly looking for new \n            opportunities and new ways to improve myself. I hope to see you in the future, whatever that may be!\n          </p>\n        </v-col>\n      </v-row>\n      <v-row>\n        <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\" style=\"padding-top: 200px\">Resume (Takes a bit to load)</h1>\n      </v-row>\n      <v-row>\n        <iframe class=\"center\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11m1oeijLPRrXTNkaxK5RPebzsDiT5c3l/preview\" width=\"75%\" height=\"880\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>\n      </v-row>\n      <v-row>\n        <v-btn class=\"center\" tile color=\"#A7121D\" dark href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=11m1oeijLPRrXTNkaxK5RPebzsDiT5c3l\" download=\"Resume.pdf\">Download</v-btn>\n      </v-row>\n    </v-container>\n  </v-app>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n  import Navbar from '../components/NavBar'\n\n  export default {\n    name: 'AboutView',\n\n    components: {\n      Navbar,\n    },\n  }\n</script>\n\n<style>\n  @import '@/css/aboutView.css';\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??clonedRuleSet-40.use[1]!../../node_modules/@vue/vue-loader-v15/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??clonedRuleSet-40.use[1]!../../node_modules/@vue/vue-loader-v15/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=360d15c4&\"\nimport script from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=360d15c4&prod&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/@vue/vue-loader-v15/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function render(){var _vm=this,_c=_vm._self._c;return _c('v-app',{staticClass:\"px-8\",style:({ background: _vm.$vuetify.theme.themes.dark.background}),attrs:{\"dark\":\"\",\"flat\":\"\"}},[_c('Navbar'),_c('section',{staticClass:\"main-container\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"item-nav-bar\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"item-nav\"},[_c('i',{staticClass:\"uil uil-angle-left left-btn\",on:{\"click\":_vm.btnLeftClick}}),_c('i',{staticClass:\"uil uil-angle-right right-btn\",on:{\"click\":_vm.btnRightClick}}),_c('ul',{staticClass:\"item-menu\",on:{\"mousemove\":_vm.mouseMove,\"mousedown\":_vm.mouseDown,\"mouseup\":_vm.mouseUp}},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"item active\",on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.tabBtnClick(0)}}},[_vm._v(\"CCC Result\")]),_c('li',{staticClass:\"item\",on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.tabBtnClick(1)}}},[_vm._v(\"Virtual Ventures\")]),_c('li',{staticClass:\"item\",on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.tabBtnClick(2)}}},[_vm._v(\"Nokia Co-Op\")]),_c('li',{staticClass:\"item\",on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.tabBtnClick(3)}}},[_vm._v(\"Earl of March Virtual Tour\")]),_c('li',{staticClass:\"item\",on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.tabBtnClick(4)}}},[_vm._v(\"Earl of March Competitive Programming Club\")])])])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"tab-content\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"tab active\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"left-column\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"img-card\"},[_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":require(\"@/assets/CCCResult.jpg\"),\"alt\":\"\"},on:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.openImage(0)}}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"right-column\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"info\"},[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"white--text titleText\"},[_vm._v(\"CCC Contest\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun competitive programming contest designed for people with an interest in coding Designed for beginners and veterans, it is a three-hour contest where participants are given problems requiring problem-solving skills which they must write out code for it.

I learned how to use Unity, C# and Java as I tried out different projects.\n                      My favourite two are: \n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R0L7FRoSW0pJyYyXSvn9eZYlKWU6jrrgWlblBRTnbBQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Botanical Rumble</a>\n                      and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A2erx_96anwyrVEBjN2hmZiu5Holr6Tvqioauukw2PY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Bubble Shooter</a>\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(3)\" src=\"@/assets/2022Instructor.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(4)\" src=\"@/assets/2022Instructor2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <p> With my last project in 2021 and the club moving to virtual, I thought it was a nice time to do \n                      something a little different. So, I took the initiative and asked the instructors running the club if I could volunteer for it. Thru this, I\n                      managed to get my 40 hours of volunteer plus a extra 90 hours as well. As 2022 rolled around, I was promoted to being a actual instructor and worked\n                      every Saturday by answering questions and helping out the students. Seeing the 12 weeks go by, I noticed a position for a full time position \n                      during Summer as a Instructor and applied. <br> <br>\n\n                      It was one of the best experiences I've ever had and I've learned a lot. I worked with kids from kindergarten all the way up to grade 9. The first\n                      week was quite chaotic but with the help of my co-workers, I got the hang of it. It was quite interesting interacting with people with much\n                      different outlooks than mine. <br> <br>\n\n                      Since then, I've worked as another Saturday Club Instructor and now fill in as a subsitude in case a instructor is missing or can't make it.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"tab\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(5)\" src=\"@/assets/NokiaLogo.webp\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\">Nokia</h1>\n                    <p>Recently, I took a co-op as a course for my semester. Seeing a opportunity for a Nokia Co-Op, I decided to take it. The Co-Op was about\n                       Software Installations and Networking. After a quick interview with it's supervisor, I got the Co-Op.<br><br>\n\n                       For the first month of the Co-Op, I spent a lot of time learning about networking and exactly how it worked. The lab I worked in was large with\n                       hundreds of chassis constantly doing jobs. However over the first month as I explored different tasks, I found a task that suited my abilities much\n                       better. One of the tools my supervisor uses quite often is something called OTS. It's basically their in house order tracking system and seeing a chance.\n                       I asked to do some tasks related to it. As a result, from the second month onwards, I was given the task to help develop and maintain the OTS website.\n                       Since the website used NodeJs, VueJs, and HTML, I had to learn quite a bit. I even used most of the knowledge gained to develop this very website.\n\n                       <br><br>\n\n                       I find this experience fascinating because it felt like my first proper work experience. My previous job as a instructor in Virtual Ventures was\n                       much more informal. This experience was different. Professionalism was at the forefront of my thoughts and I really felt the gap of experience between\n                       me and some of my co-workers. Problems which may take hours for me to solve was a problem they experienced before and can easily solved it. This Co-Op\n                       experience taught me a lot and widen my horizons on what I was capable of doing.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"tab\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(6)\" src=\"@/assets/EarlofMarchLogo.png\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\">Grade 12 CS Project</h1>\n                    <p> Back in 2021, I took my Grade 12 CS class early because I was really excited for it. As a result, when we were given the task of developing our \n                      own project of our choice, I smiled as I recalled my VV experience. Thinking about the project, I ultimately decided to develop a Earl of March Virtual\n                      Tour where you can explore the school from anywhere.   <br><br>\n\n                      However at the end of the semester I felt a bit unsatisfied with the product. As such, I talked with a guidance counsellor at my school and \n                      decided to continue the project. I even managed to get a paid for the extra work I did on the project by the school itself. At the end of the project,\n                      you can visit the inside and outdoor areas of the school, path system to find specific rooms and lots of options for customization.\n\n                      <br><br>If you want to see the final product you can click \n                      <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w0Su5SMSDWzM00CLSP4brSDWwLz8cb-B/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>\n                      <br>Code for the project could also be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Kevew/Earl-of-March-VirtualTour\">here</a>\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"tab\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(7)\" src=\"@/assets/ClubAdvertisement.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <h1 class=\"white--text titleText\">Founding A Club</h1>\n                    <p> In 2021, wanting to further my competitive programming skills, I co-founded the Competitive Programming Club with one of my friends. Having\n                      pratically no experience in such a thing, the first year of the club went so-so. We had two weekly meetings where we dicussed algorithms and \n                      solved problems. However due to a lack of experience, we didn't get many members. Despite that we persevered all the way to the end of the school year\n                      and prepared for next year. <br> <br>\n\n                      This year went much better. Using last year's experience, we turned to club back into in-person meetings and managed to get a average active member count of 6-7\n                      people. Me and my co-founder decided that it would be better to have one meeting per week this year and worked out presentations for the members where\n                      we discuss ideas, problems and algorithms to them. We also do a virtual contests with them where we have fun competiting againsn't each other for fun.\n                      All in all, it's been a great experience with them.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"left-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(8)\" src=\"@/assets/ClubContest.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"img-card\">\n                    <img @click=\"openImage(8)\" src=\"\" alt=\"\">\n                    <p>another image</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"right-column\">\n                  <div class=\"info\">\n                    <p> Here are some examples of our dicussions: <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3vfKaHoYgg565cam1942WoJPU4ZWSTmaOQa6EqYHww/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion Of A Problem</a> <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uqlGYOVXFEdq3BgKva775yKgqx-XtmqYBwUPJXSPYWo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion of ASCII</a> <br>\n                      <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XOsFTnPsaDgy6FpFZP7jSH49OK5cyZZoR0U1_1999xM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Dicussion of Sorting</a>\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <div class=\"popup-img\">\n        <span @click=\"closeImage\">&times;</span>\n        <img src=\"@/assets/CCCResult.jpg\">\n      </div>\n  </v-app>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\nimport Navbar from '../components/NavBar'\n\nexport default{\n  name: 'AchievementsView',\n  components: {\n      Navbar,\n  },\n  data () {\n      return {\n          itemMenu: [],\n          btnLeft: [],\n          btnRight: [],\n          activeDrag: false,\n          tabs: [],\n          items: [],\n          popUpImage: [],\n          popUp: [],\n          allImages: []\n      }\n  },\n  methods: {\n      checkVisibility(){\n          let scrollLeftValue = Math.ceil(this.itemMenu.scrollLeft);\n          let scrollableWidth = this.itemMenu.scrollWidth - this.itemMenu.clientWidth;\n          this.btnLeft.style.display = scrollLeftValue > 0 ?
