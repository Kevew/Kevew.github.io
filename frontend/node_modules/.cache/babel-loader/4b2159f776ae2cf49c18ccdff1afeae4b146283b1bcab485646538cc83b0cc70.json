When I was first introduced to it, I loved the logical aspect of it. Subjects such as writing and art can have multiple\n             answers where unlike Mathematics, there will always be a single most efficent way of solving a problem. Finding that problem was especially fun for me.\n             Back in 2016-2017, I dipped my toes into the competitive field of math and put in quite some effort. Most of my pratice stemmed from <a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/online\"> AOPS </a>\n             and <a href=\"https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html\">Waterloo Contests</a> such as Gauss and Pascal. I even did quite good in the AMC8 where \n             I achieved 3rd place in Ottawa. \n          </p>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"3\">\n          <v-img src=\"@/assets/logo.png\" contain max-height=\"500\"></v-img>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"3\">\n          <v-img src=\"@/assets/logo.png\" contain max-height=\"500\"></v-img>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"6\">\n          <p class=\"grey--text\">\n            As of 2022, I currently go to Earl of March (Secondary School).
