When I was first introduced to it, I loved the logical aspect of it. Subjects such as writing and art can have multiple\n             answers where unlike Mathematics, there will always be a single most efficent way of solving a problem. Finding that problem was especially fun for me.\n             Back in 2015-2017, I dipped my toes into the competitive field of math and put in quite some effort. Most of my pratice stemmed from <a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/online\"> AOPS </a>\n             and <a href=\"https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html\">Waterloo Contests</a> such as Gauss and Pascal. I even did quite good in the AMC8 where \n             I achieved 3rd place in Ottawa. However, while I enjoyed these problems I felt as though math was too restrictive and lacked any sort of goal. In 2017-2018, this \n             sense of directionless started to affect me in my interest. I was starting to get bored with math.\n             <br> <br>\n             But just as my interset in math wavered, a new interest was begining to rise. Programming. I first came across programming through a youtube series\n             where the youtuber developed a snake game  as well as a tank game (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5F-aGDIYaM&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq\">link</a>). \n             Looking back, I realized that I 100% was copying his code without understanding it. However, as I saw my program develop with each tutorial I was getting more and more\n             immersed.\n             <br>\n             Much like mathematics, Programming was 100% logical. \n             It had a strict set of rules but gave enough freedom to explore so many more pathways that math quickly faded from my mind. \n          </p>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"3\">\n          <v-img src=\"@/assets/logo.png\" contain max-height=\"500\"></v-img>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"3\">\n          <v-img src=\"@/assets/logo.png\" contain max-height=\"500\"></v-img>\n        </v-col>\n        <v-col cols=\"6\">\n          <p class=\"grey--text\">\n            As of 2022, I currently go to Earl of March (Secondary School).
